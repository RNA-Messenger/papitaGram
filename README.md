## petPals

### Showcase your love animals... 

First petPals social network try

UPDATE 30/08: might end up killing this project and moving the core functionality to blockchain. Need to checkout making a smart contract with the pet info.

Meanwhile, this can stay as a React practice.

### TODO:

- Need to check how to refetch and refresh favs
- I don't think the user registration is working correctly
- Need to add loading animations
- Clean up structure, I think it might be getting too confusing, idk

### Fun Points:
The deploying is working great so far and the esthetic are quite clean, guess that's something!
