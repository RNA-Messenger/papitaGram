## petPals

### Showcase your love animals... 

First petPals social network try

UPDATE 05/09: Leaving this app to be part of portfolio and killing petPals. Will also use it to practice graphql.

### TODO:
- Bug: Need to register 2 to access auth routes.
- Compiler is working fine now, but deploy is broken.
- Need to add loading animations
- Clean up structure: remove containers.

### Fun Points:
The deploying is working great so far and the esthetic are quite clean, guess that's something!
(LOL! it isn't anymore...)
Will check this tomorrow, might need to create a new instance in vercel.
I've implemented PWA and Performance bits and will add Cypress soon. Might look into adding PropTypes as well just to use it at least.
