### Showcase your love animals... 

First petPals social network try

UPDATE: might end up killing this project and moving the core functionality to blockchain. Need to checkout making a smart contract with the pet info.

Meanwhile, this can stay as a React practice.

### TODO:
- Amend repo name to PetPals, will impact vercel deploy config
- Filter by Category not working, need to check

### Fun Points:
The deploying set up is working tho the data looks broken now
